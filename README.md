## Constructor: The Character Creator
Hi, and thank you for taking a look at my third project of my development immersive.  I was tasked with building a full stack app and I couldn't be happier with the progress I've made with it!

## Purpose:
My purpose for this project was to build a database that holds created fantasy characters.  While browsing the internet, I've noticed that there were many sites that allowed you to visually manipulate a stock fantasy character: like changing the clothes a vampire/fairy/elf wears or creating the body of characters as well, but I noticed that there was a lack in sites that focused on the more descriptive qualities of this character.  And so Constructor was born for those to flesh out these qualities.  I envision Constructor being visited by authors and gamers: both table-top and video.
